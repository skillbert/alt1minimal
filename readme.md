# Minimal Alt1/webpack/typescript example

How to use
```sh
# To initialize the repo and install dependencies:
npm i
# Build your code:
npm run build
# Or, alternatively to auto-rebuild when source files are changed:
npm run watch
```

You can open `./dist/index.html` in your browser and it will give some basic functionality based on pasted images.

You can also open it in the Alt1 browser and click the `add app` button that appears to get some basic alt1 functionality.
